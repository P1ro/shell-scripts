# Rules for telling git which files to ignore, mainly based on
# extension but also accounting for some idiosyncratic usages.
#
# Note:
# - This is shared across projects, so there might seem to be
#   some apparently extraneous patterns included.
# - Used to pruned 'git status' output, which gets
#   shown during check-in's (as a sanity check).
# - The patterns are glob-like with the extension that **/GLOB
#   matches the glob pattern in any subdirectory.
# - See 'man gitignore' for details.

# Log files and listings
# TODO: figure out how to apply to subdirs
**/*.log
**/*.list

# Any files with _
# note: "I know, I know, ... what about __init__.py?!"
# TODO: whitelist command cases
**/_*

# Backup file
**/*.bak
**/backup/

# Old or archived files
**/old
**/archive

# Output or log-file directories
**/log-files
**/output-files

# Idiosyncratic stuff for Tom

# ex: reempl-notes.txt
**/*notes*txt
