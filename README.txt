This directory contains a collection of useful and not so useful utilities, predominantly in Perl. Many of these have been developed at NMSU pre-Y2K, but some were developed or refined in industry. (Several of the scripts were developed in support of the GraphLing project directed by Janyce Wiebe [requiescat in pace] and Rebecca Bruce.)

This also includes a few scripts developed by others, such as the handy tkdiff and the Perl interface into Merriam Webster's online dictionary. Also, some of the GraphLing scripts are here for my convenience.

There is no overall documentation, but the scripts themselves are generally well documented.

Common abbreviations, which might not be apparent (e.g., to non-native speakers of English):
  n.b.     note; Latin for "note well"
  wrt	   with respect to

See template.bash for a cheatsheet of the subset of Bash I generally use. Besides Bash, I'm guilty of using Perl too much. I would like to use Python more often, but it is not a good scripting language when many shell calls are involved. (By the way, see bash2python.py for work-in-progress on converting the common Bash constructs I use into Python. Also, look into using OpenAI's Codex for Bash to Python translation.)
