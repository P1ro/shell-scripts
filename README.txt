This directory contains a collection of useful and not so useful utilities, predominantly in Perl. Most of these have been developed at NMSU, but some were developed or refined in industry. (Several of the scripts were developed in support of the GraphLing project directed by Janyce Wiebe [requiescat in pace] and Rebecca Bruce.)

This also includes a few scripts developed by others, such as the handy tkdiff and the Perl interface into Merriam Webster's online dictionary. Also, some of the GraphLing scripts are here for my convenience.

There is no overall documentation, but the scripts themselves are generally well documented.
